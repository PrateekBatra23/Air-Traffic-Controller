# ‚úàÔ∏è Air Traffic Control (ATC) Simulation

## üìå Overview
This project simulates an **Air Traffic Control (ATC)** system as a full-stack web application.  
It showcases **core Operating System concepts** such as:
- Scheduling (priority-based: Emergency > VIP > Normal)
- Resource management (runways, taxiways, gates)
- Synchronization and concurrency
- Real-time event handling with WebSockets  

The system manages flight operations (landing, taxiing, docking, departure) while providing a **modern, interactive dashboard** for visualization.
